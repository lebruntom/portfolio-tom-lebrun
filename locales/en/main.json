I thrive in this program and I discovered the joys of web development, and therefore, I have the ambition to pursue a career in this field. To this end, I intend to continue my studies by pursuing an MBA or a Master's degree in relation to web development. I am therefore currently looking for a work-study position for the 2023-2024 academic year to allow me to complete the training I am aiming for.",
